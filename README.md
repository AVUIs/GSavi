# GS.avi
beta2 code

GS.avi is a gestural instrument that generates continuous spatial visualizations and music from the input of a performer. The features extracted form a performer’s gesture defines the color, position, form and orientation of a 3-dimensional Delaunay mesh. The music, composed using granular synthesis, is generated from features extracted from the mesh. The project was created using Processing and MAX/MSP. OSC is used to communicate between the two.

# MAX/MSP Usage

NOTE: The current MAX/MSP patch uses sound samples to simulate the sound generated by the visuals. In this version, the visual features do not generate the audio. You’ll need 5 sound samples.

# 1: To use this patch:

A. Download the MAX/MSP dependencies as listed in the following section, extract them and put them in the PACKAGES folder where MAX/MSP is installed on your computer.

B. (OPTIONAL, 5 example sounds are provided in GSavi > snd) Store 5 sound files named 1.wav, 2.wav, … 5.wav in GSavi > snd. 

C. Open the file GSavi.maxpat. 

D. Disable the PRESENTATION MODE of the patch and look for the 5 SHAKER objects (spaced horizontally near the middle of the patch).

J. For each SHAKER object (1 through 5), double click to open the encapsulated patch. Click LOAD FILE and import each respective sound file (named 1.wav, 2.wav, … 5.wav) into each SHAKER object (named “one” through “cinco”).

K. After the sound files are loaded, re-enable the PRESENTATION MODE of the patch.

L. Press the SPACE BAR to toggle the sound on and off (or click on the sound icon on the bottom right of the patch to start the sound).

# Processing Usage

A. Start the Processing sketch.

B. Use the trackpad or mouse to begin drawing in the Processing window.

C. To enable different Fill and Stroke combination (not yet controlled by sound):
Press ‘a’ to enable Fill()
Press ‘b’ to enable noFill()
Press ‘c’ to enable Stroke()
Press ‘d’ to enable noStroke()

D. To override the background drawn treatment to enable a different drawing mode (not yet controlled by sound):
Press ‘e’ to enable the different mode
Press ‘f’ to disable the different mode# MAX/MSP Dependencies
